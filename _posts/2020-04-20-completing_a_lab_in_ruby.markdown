Labs are of course the bulk of the work in the curriculum, and the concept itself seems fairly straightforward. You read the material, read the instructions in the lab, attempt to meet the requirements and refer back to the material if necessary. I don't quite follow this particular path however.

I start off reading the material of course, but for whatever reason I have a habit of skipping the instructions and going straight to running tests to see what is being asked of me. Somehow that makes more sense to me than reading the lab text. It's probably a bad habit to have, but it seems to have worked for me so far.

I've also learned that Google is awesome and there is a plethora of information pertaining to every issue I may have. ecause oftentimes while the material is helpful, it doesn't always answer all my questions. So if you find yourself stuck, don't be afraid to utilize this valuable resource.
