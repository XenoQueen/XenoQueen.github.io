One of my biggest struggles with learning to code is not only learning the curriculum, but doing it in a way my brain understands. I am on the autism spectrum, and while that is by no means a bad thing, it does present its own challenges.

The most significant hurdle I face is with focus. I get distracted very easily, and wil oftentimes lose hours pursuing whatever has grabbed my attention. I call this "falling down a rabbit hole", because that is essentially what it feels like. One distraction leads to another and another, then I find myself coming out of it hours later with no idea what I was even doing in the first place.

Another matter I have to deal with is hyperfixation. Quite often I will hyperfocus on a detail or topic that has nothing to do with whatever I'm trying to do, and I will be unable to tear my attention away. This has led to all manner of issues in my academic and professional life, from late or missing school projects to write ups at work for incomplete tasks. 

Lastly, another obstacle of concentrating while autistic is how much I struggle to focus on things that do not particularly interest me. Because as much as I enjoy coding and am looking forward to how many doors such knowledge will open, some of the topics are just not that exciting. And as imperative as they are to learning coding, my brain has a habit of dismissing them as immaterial, foundational though they may be.

So here is a little snapshot into my neurodivergent brain while I try to learn a thing I have almost no experience with. But as scary and monumentally stressful as it is, I've still managed to come this far, and I have every intention of completing this course. I just may have to get a little creative.
