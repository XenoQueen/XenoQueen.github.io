Well it's officially the end of week 4, and like many others, I am thoroughly confused and lost. There are a lot of formulas and concepts in Ruby, each seemingly more complicated than the last. The current one that is tripping me up is object relationships.

Object relationships is basically writing multiple objects that interact with each other in certain ways. For example, "is a" would be setting an instance of a class, which will then share attributes of the associated class. Easy as that concept may be, it is "has many" that has brought my progress to a  halt.

"Has many" is defining multiple objects and keeping track of which object owns what, how many they own, and what dependencies exist between them.

This is all well and good in theory, but the act of writing code in this manner is still perplexing. And as (bad) luck would have it, this is one of the main concepts I will need to employ to complete this module's final. And with the deadline approaching, I am definitely feeling the strain.
